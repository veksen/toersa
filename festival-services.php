						Whether you are hosting an event or concert, the protection of artists or keynote speakers is paramount. In addition, it is important to properly monitor the safety of event participants. Our experienced Stage Security Team is trained to provide professional security while acting as the physical separation between patrons and on-stage personalities. They are trained to notice patrons that may be suffering from heat stroke, exhaustion or other medical conditions. Such patrons are immediately removed from the crowd and provided medical attention in a less congested environment. The Security Team is also trained to monitor the facial expressions and body language of patrons in order to stay current on changes to the environment. This proactive approach allows the Team to prevent incidents like a breach of the physical barrier or disturbances within the crowd.

					<p>
						Revenues from admission are another major source of income for events, concerts, shows, and festivals. Qualified security guards posted at points of entry help to ensure that patrons gaining access to the site possess proper tickets, identification passes or other admission credentials. Further, the control of which objects are permitted to be brought into the building or site is essential to the safety of patrons. Proper screening at access points will help prevent weapons, alcoholic beverages, illegal substances, and other objects from being brought into the site. Ultimately, effective access management systems are important to the success of an event.

				<div class="section-body col-md-12">
					<p>
						Security patrols is an essential part of festival security operations. Patrols are the main line of defense in and around the festival grounds. They respond to emergency calls, deter underage drinking, and ensue the safety of both staff and patrons. TOERSA’s patrols have years of experience, appropriate training and are able to deal with any situation that may arise.P

					<h2>Undercover Surveillance</h2>

				</div>
				<div class="section-body col-md-12">
					<p>
						When dealing with thousands of patrons, it is always difficult for security guards to keep an eye on everything. Many times when security is visible patrons go out of their way to hide if they are doing something that they should not be doing. (i.e. Underage Drinking) To combat this, TOERSA has assembled and trained a group of undercover surveillance agents that blend into the crowd and see the many things that patrons go out of their way to hide.

						The service of alcohol is often the most profitable aspect of events and festivals. Unfortunately, the risks associated with this service are often the greatest. TOERSA Security specializes in on-site enforcement of the responsible service of alcohol by handling alcohol related issues at events and festivals with certified staff to reduce the risk and liability of serving alcohol.

					<p>TOERSA Security is proud to be a registered supplier of the Ontario Security Guard Curriculum.
					 The 40 hour course is offered regularly, be sure to check frequently for new dates. Course Payment
					  can be made on-site by cash or money order. Seating is subject to availability. Pre-payment is the
					   preferred reservation method. Your placement in a course is not guaranteed until you have received
					    a confirmation email from TOERSA Security. Refunds are subject to administration fees. The Private
					     Security and Investigative Services Branch of the Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services
					      has taken many steps to regulate the role of a security guard in an effort to create more accountability
					       and provide a better service to the public. The basic Training and Testing Regulation took effect on April
					        15, 2010. This Regulation helps strengthen the professional requirements for security guards and private
					         investigators and enhance public safety. For more information, visit the Ministry of Community Safety and
					          Correctional Services Website.

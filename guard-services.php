						Revenues from admission are another major source of income for events, concerts, shows, and festivals. Qualified security guards posted at points of entry help to ensure that patrons gaining access to the site possess proper tickets, identification passes or other admission credentials. Further, the control of which objects are permitted to be brought into the building or site is essential to the safety of patrons. Proper screening at access points will help prevent weapons, alcoholic beverages, illegal substances, and other objects from being brought into the site. Ultimately, effective access management systems are important to the success of an event.

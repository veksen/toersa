					<p>TOERSA Security specializes in the handling of alcohol related issues at events and festivals. “TOERSA” is an acronym for two of the services we provide, Training and On-site Enforcement of the Responsible Service of Alcohol. Through pre-event training of all staff members and on-site enforcement, we greatly decrease the likelihood of any problems related to the sale or service of alcohol. TOERSA’s primary focus is major events and festivals that serve alcohol to the public in Ottawa and the surrounding area. These organizations typically have a special operating permit (SOP) in order to sell and serve alcohol to the public. SOPs are issued through the Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO).
